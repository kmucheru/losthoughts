==============INTRODUCTION======================================================

This is an experimental blog engine built by rails for everyone.

Its stack is as follows

-Linux OS

-Nginx Web servers

-Postgres Database

-Ruby_on_Rails application

-Blog content by voices in the creators head.

================================================================================

Built using TDD-inspired techniques

Please follow commit history to see development stages

Also available are style sheet projects that could pretty much help you get
  what is going on.

The fully functional frame-work went in before styling was applied.

Stacking this way makes the application much more scalable (code_wise)

Please note that the application might have integration issues when running in
  a Windows environment. This is because my development machine is Linux; so is
  the hosting server. In line with keeping matters slim and DRY (Don't Repeat
   Yourself) Rails conventions, windows was outed.

   Please contact the developer if this becomes an issue. Nobody ever reads this.
================================================================================

Bare level frame includes the fully functional blog without any styling.
